        <p class="landing-body">On the stock market, investors buy and sell shares of ownership in publicly traded companies, primarily electronically or over the internet
            Investors decide to buy or sell based on the company’s performance, economic conditions, the current price of the shares, and other factors, driving the price of the stock up or down
            Owning a stock also gives you the opportunity to have a say in how that company is run, and companies sometimes pay their investors directly through dividends.</p>

                <h4>Risk tolerance</h4>
                <li>    
                    <p class="landing-body">Before investing, you should consider your risk tolerance. More volatile stocks can provide opportunities for greater financial gain, but also larger losses.</p>
                </li>  
                <h4>Time horizon</h4>
                <li>
                    <p class="landing-body">Short-term Investing: Buying stocks with the intent of selling within a few months or years. This includes day trading or swing trading.
                        Long-term Investing: Buying stocks and holding them for many years to benefit from long-term growth, often through index funds or the stocks of large companies with a solid history of growth.

                <h4>Diversification</h4>
                <li>
                    <p class="landing-body">Concentrating your investments in one company or sector can be risky, so experts recommend “diversifying”, or spreading your investments across multiple industries, markets, and types of assets can reduce risk.</p>
                </li>

    <h2>Index funds</h2>
    <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col-lg-4" id="abt3"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-1"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
        <p class="landing-body">An index fund tracks the performance of a specific stock market index, like the S&P 500, providing broad market exposure by investing in all the companies in the index. This diversification helps reduce risk, and because index funds are passively managed, they typically come with lower fees compared to actively managed funds. They're good for long-term investors seeking steady growth over time without the need to pick individual stocks.</p>
